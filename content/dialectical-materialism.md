[Dialectical materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism) is a philosophy of science and nature developed in Europe and based on the writings of *Karl Marx* and *Friedrich Engels*. Marxist dialectics emphasizes the importance of real-world conditions, in terms of class, labor, and socioeconomic interactions. This is in contrast to the *Hegelian dialectic*, which emphasized the idealist observation that human experience is dependent on the mind's perceptions. Marx supposed that these material conditions contained contradictions which seek resolution in new forms of social organization.

**Dialectical materialism** accepts the evolution of the natural world and the emergence of new qualities of being at new stages of evolution. As *Z. A. Jordan* noted, Engels made constant use of the metaphysical insight that the higher level of existence emerges from and has its roots in the lower; that the higher level constitutes a new order of being with its irreducible laws; and that this process of evolutionary advance is governed by laws of development which reflect basic properties of *matter in motion as a whole*.

The formulation of the `Soviet` version of dialectical and historical materialism in the **1930s** by *Joseph Stalin* and his associates (such as in Stalin's book *Dialectical and Historical Materialism*), became the official Soviet interpretation of `Marxism`.
